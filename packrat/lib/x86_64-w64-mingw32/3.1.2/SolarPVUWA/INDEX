calculate_postcode_pv   This script calculated the mean and standard
                        deviation for a month-day combination using the
                        processed values created by the
                        massSolarCruncher script by Grant Coble-Neale.
                        The script then calculated the outputs of PV
                        installations in the specified postcode for
                        cases corresponding to the mean and upper and
                        lower bounds of the 90th percentile for
