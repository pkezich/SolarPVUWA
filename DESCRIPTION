Description: This package generates an estimate for the PV output of Western Australian Postcodes by first creating models for irradiation and ambient temperature and then passing them through the model for a solar PV installation obtained from the SolaR package. The central function of the package calculate_postcode_pv() produces a data fram containing the mean and upper and lower bounds of the 90th percentile for PV output.
